## Game history. Basic rules and gameplay of the game.

Okey Card Game is a popular minigame that originated in the MMORPG [Metin2](https://pl.metin2.gameforge.com/landing/partner). It is often played during the holiday season and is known for its detailed gameplay and strategy.

In Okey Card Game, players aim to collect points by selecting three cards from a deck of 24. The cards must follow a certain logic, such as being in consecutive numerical order (e.g. 2, 3, 4) or having the same number (e.g. 5, 5, 5). Players can also earn more points by arranging the cards in the same color.

The game is divided into different point tiers, with rewards given out based on the number of points a player earns. If a player earns 300 or more points, they will receive a silver Okey chest as a reward. If they earn 400 or more points, they will receive a gold Okey chest. If they earn less than 300 points, they will receive a bronze Okey chest.

Overall, Okey Card Game is a fun and exciting game that requires strategy and skill to excel at. Its popularity in Metin2 and its unique gameplay make it a beloved minigame among players

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Check out this mini-game here:

https://okey-card-game.netlify.app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
